Array : 
1. Constant time for access. O(1)
2. Address to all the elements is available.
3. Fixed size.
4. Contigouous memory is required.
5. Insertion - a) at begining = O(n) b) at end= O(1) c) at Nth position = O(n)
6. Ease of use - array.

Linked List : 
1. Linear time for access. O(n)
2. Address of head node is only known.
3. No unused memory, extra memory for pointer variable.
4. Random allocation of memory.
5. Insertion - a) at begining = O(1) b) at end= O(n) c) at Nth position = O(n)
